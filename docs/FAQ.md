## Usage Questions

### How does the AI code generation work?

openWebDev uses advanced AI models to generate code based on your descriptions. You simply describe what you want to build, and the AI generates the appropriate code snippets.

### Is my code secure when using openWebDev?

Yes, your code is secure. The sandbox environment is isolated, and we don't store or transmit your code to external servers unless you explicitly configure it to do so.

### Can I customize the generated code?

Yes, you can fully customize the generated code. The preview area allows you to edit the code directly before applying it to your project.

### How does package detection work?

openWebDev automatically analyzes generated code to identify required packages. When packages are detected, they're listed in the interface with options to install them automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is the AI not generating code?

This could be due to several reasons:
- Check your API key configuration
- Verify your internet connection
- Ensure your request is clear and specific
- Check the console for error messages

### The sandbox is not working, what should I do?

If the sandbox environment is not functioning:
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify your system meets the requirements
- Review the sandbox logs for error messages
- Restart the development server
